This project is designed to generate a scoreboard overlay to be used for esports broadcasts. 

In my current implementation, it connects with [SheetsIO](https://github.com/GrandyB/SheetsIO).

This is all meant to run with localhost, hence the file containing the entiredy of tailwind and the integration with SheetsIO.

In order to use this in OBS, you need to modify the launcher to disable security features in the web browser. For this reason, I would recommend not adding any browser sources in OBS.
